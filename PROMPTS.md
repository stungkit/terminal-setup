Study my repo(s) thoroughly and give me specific answers relative to the repo(s). It must follow the best coding standards. Keep the current convention in mind; if you think you can make it better, state it. Keep it simple. Double check your work. Show me the exact complete changes. Donâ€™t be lazy. Don't show me examples snippets. Show me the exact real changes. Make sure your responses are well formatted. Do not make unnecessary changes to the existing code unless needed.

Given my diff against main, write tests for me to test out my changes. Try your best to see if you can include these tests in existing test files, existing classes, or existing methods. Otherwise, add new ones. Follow my testing conventions in my repo as well. If there is an opportunity to make existing tests better by refactoring or anything else, do state it. Show me the completed files so I can copy and paste the entire content back in. Do not make unnecessary changes to the existing code unless needed.
